## Notes of the interests of the theme
Glitch has the meaning of error. Looking at various digital works related to Glitches, I found many works with striking colours, and this topic could interest users a lot. Thinking about how to create my creative outcome, I chose the artwork and the reading first. While looking at artwork and readings, a reading called ‘Chapter 3: The End of the Internet’ caught my eye. I wanted to express this era of infinite information as a work and this digital age in which we live through digital art.
<br>
<br>
I received positive feedback from my professor on the outcomes of Workshop 3 and Workshop 5. Based on this, I decided to develop my creative outcome further.
<br>
<br>- Workshop 3  : involved creating collages using buttons.
<br>- Workshop 5 : focused on designing a dropdown menu using my portrait data.
<br>
<br>Building on these two experiments, I developed the following ideas.

## Creative outcome ideas
- Using collage techniques to express glitches could be an interesting approach.
- Overlapping and errors themselves can become a form of art.
- Dropdown menus could be utilized to create a new vibe.
- Integrating internet-sourced elements (memes, maps, words, information, etc.) would add depth to the piece.

<br>Thus, my creative outcome is structured as follows:
<br>

- Dropdown menu featuring memes, maps, and words.
- Glitch-like background effects.
- A webcam function positioned at the centre.
- Five or more images assigned to each dropdown selection.
- Applying cracked or blurry filters to each image.
<br>
My creative outcome does not involve actual glitches occurring; instead, it visually represents the essence of a glitch. I refined my approach based on selected artworks and readings. Specifically, Rosa Menkman’s A Vernacular of File Formats inspired me, as it intentionally introduces file corruption to create art. However, my approach differs: rather than inducing real glitches, I simulate the appearance of glitches through visual outcome.

## Progress
First, I had to decide on the background. To give users a strong visual effect, I searched for glitches and explored how these effects could be implemented in p5.js.

<br>

While exploring the p5.js documentation and searching for various effects, I found an interesting glitch effect implemented through code. (noise)

I applied noise-like effects to the background and implemented an interactive element that makes it feel slightly laggy as if experiencing a glitch. This way, users can feel as though they are navigating within a glitchy, distorted environment, enhancing the immersive experience of the work. I experimented with modifying the numeric values in the code to understand how different elements would change. By adjusting the numbers, I observed various transformations, such as changes in line shapes, colour variations, and alterations in the thickness of the lag-like effect.

<br>
After deciding to use this as a background, I adjusted the numeric values to what I found most suitable. These modifications influenced the background's colour, the line's thickness, the glitches' speed and overall appearance.
<br>
<br>
Next, I decided to place a webcam function at the centre. https://editor.p5js.org/jeffThompson/sketches/ael8Y4YMB  
The reason behind this decision was that I wanted to represent myself as a person surrounded by infinite information. I intended the users to feel this as well. In addition, I wanted to include more elements related to the glitch, so I experimented with various filters on the camera. However, applying a filter also affected the background, which took some time to resolve.
I managed to fix this issue by adjusting the order of the filter function in the code. Additionally, I tested multiple numeric values to position the camera at the centre accurately.
